### Ideas
- TextEditorGroup tabs drag out to make a Dialog of that file specifically.
- TextEditorGroup tabs drag out then show a 5 dropzone "grid".
    - One can drop on the left dropdown to make another text editor to the left of the current one and etc...
- Multi-cursor logic
- Collapse lines logic
