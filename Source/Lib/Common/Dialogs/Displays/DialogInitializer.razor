	TODO: Would wrapping the foreach in a div i.e.:
		  
		  <div class="luth_dialog-initializer"></div>
		  
		  Cause the gaps between dialogs to create invisible walls
		  or some other weird behaviors?
		  
		  It is (2024-05-26), I can't recall if I left out an encompassing
		  div for a reason or not, but I don't have time to look into this
		  at the moment.

@foreach (var dialog in dialogList)
{
    <DialogDisplay @key="dialog.DynamicViewModelKey" 
                   Dialog="dialog" />
}
