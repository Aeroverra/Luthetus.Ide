	### Fixed
	- Most documentation issues I found are fixed.
	- All NuGet Packages mentioned are at version 1.3.0 as well to avoid confusion.
	- .NET 6 Blazor-WASM worked after following documentation start to finish.
	- .NET 6 Blazor-ServerSide after following documentation start to finish.
	
	### Bugs
	- .NET 6 is hard-coded as the target framework. Therefore, .NET 7 apps are not working. I need to remedy this in later versions.
