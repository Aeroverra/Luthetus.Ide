### .NET sln
.NET sln needs to be an immutable type
which is accessed through a `DotNetSolutionKey`.

All modifications to a .NET sln need be done via the `DotNetSolutionReducer`.

One can view the current state of a `DotNetSolution` by looking up into the `DotNetSolutionCollection` using a `DotNetSolutionKey`.

### Background Tasks
The current implementation of IBackgroundTaskQueue for the WASM host is incorrect.

I realized that each enqueue'd task was being invoked immediately, even if a prior task was still running.

This logic needs to be fixed, I think I've seen some oddities going on in the WASM app, and this might explain a few of them.
