I want to improve the documentation.

## 2023-08-16

In the README.md I want to add:
- "Input File Dialog:" needs a gif.
- "NuGet Package Manager" needs a gif.
- "Themes" needs a gif.
- Why do some section titles have a ':' and some don't? See "Input File Dialog:" and "NuGet Package Manager"

- I want to fix the freezing bug.
- I want to improve the UI.

> Website lacks Terminal

When it comes to the website, there is a question of: "How many features can I fake, given that there is no terminal".

For example, how do I run the selected start-up project?

I need to list what features don't work in the website:

- Run selected start-up project
- New .NET Solution
- New C# Project
- Move C# Project to Solution Folder
- Modify C# Project to reference a NuGet Package
- Modify C# Project to reference another C# Project

Now, I need to evaluate the question "How many features can I fake, given that there is no terminal".

I think the answer is I can fake everything except for "Run selected start-up project"

In that case, is there a sensible work-around to "Run selected start-up project"?

I believe it is reasonable that for the website, one can `import compressed archives` and then they'll be loaded into the `InMemoryFileSystem`.

Furthermore, one should be able to `export as a compressed archive` the entirety of their `InMemoryFileSystem`.

I believe this `import` and `export` logic, to be a reasonable solution to not being able to run one's code. They can export, then run it, if so desired.

> .NET Solution Lexing

I want to `lex` the entirety of a `.NET Solution`.

The C# class which models the lexed .NET Solution should understand the underlying text file from which it was read.

That is to say, if a .NET Solution contains a C# Project reference. Then, the model representing the C# Project reference should have a `TextSpan which maps back to the .sln text file`.

I need to replicate the .NET CLI in order to run the website in the browser. This is because there is no terminal, so IDE lacks most functionality if I don't do this.

I've previously lexed the .NET Solutions using a class I called, "DotNetSolutionParser".

I added parameters to the `DotNetSolutionParser.Parse(...)` method for "intercepting" various stages of a .NET Solution Parse:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// The 'Func&lt;string, string&gt;? intercept...' parameters are quite hacky.<br/><br/>
/// 
/// Use them to add an existing project to a solution,
/// in an environment where the .NET CLI is not available.<br/><br/>
/// 
/// For example, the demo website Luthetus.Ide.Wasm uses these
/// parameters to modify the solution.<br/><br/>
/// 
/// The string parameter that goes into an intercept Func is the
/// remaining text.<br/>
/// 
/// The out, is what the new remaining text should be (it overwrites the previous remaining text).<br/><br/>
/// 
/// This lets one 'fake' that a C# Project existed by "modifying" the solution as it is read.<br/><br/>
/// 
/// Lastly use interceptPriorToReturning to write out the modified solution file text contents.
/// </summary>
public static DotNetSolution Parse(
        string content,
        NamespacePath namespacePath,
        IEnvironmentProvider environmentProvider,
        Func<string, NamespacePath, string>? interceptParseDotNetProject = null,
        Func<string, NamespacePath, string>? interceptParseGuid = null,
        Func<string, NamespacePath, string>? interceptParseStringValue = null,
        Func<string, NamespacePath, string>? interceptParseGlobalSectionNestedProjects = null,
        Action<string, NamespacePath>? interceptPriorToReturning = null)
```

I was able to add a C# Project to a .NET Solution on the website by doing this intercept logic.

I would pass in a Func to the parameter `interceptParseDotNetProject`. This mutated the contents which were being parsed, as the parse was being performed.

Then `interceptPriorToReturning` would write to the file system, the modified contents, which contained the added C# Project.

It felt super weird and I didn't like it.

``` csharp
public interface IDotNetSolution
{
    // Ommitted for conciseness
}

public class DotNetSolutionFileMapped : IDotNetSolution
{
    private List<DotNetProjectFileMapped>? _dotNetProjectContainer = new();

    public ImmutableList<IDotNetProject> DotNetProjectContainer =>  
    _dotNetProjectContainer.Select(x => x.Project).ToImmutableArray();

    public void AddDotNetProject(IDotNetProject dotNetProject)
    {
        var lastProject = _dotNetProjectContainer
            .Last();

        var dotNetProjectFileMapped
    }
    
    public async Task PersistAsync()
    {
        

        File.WriteAllTextAsync(/* write out the .sln */);
    }

    // Ommitted for conciseness
}
```

``` csharp
public interface IDotNetProject
{
    
}

public class DotNetProjectFileMapped
{
    public IDotNetProject DotNetProject { get; }
    public TextSpan TextSpan { get; }
}
```
