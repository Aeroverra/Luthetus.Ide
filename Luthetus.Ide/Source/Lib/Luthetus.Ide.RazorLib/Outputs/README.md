The Outputs folder relates to displaying text in a way that is interactive.

For example, the terminal might have standard output which says an error
occurred in file "aaa.cs" at line number "32".

The desire for Outputs folder is to click on that error text and go to that line
in the text editor.

Outputs commonly will be used for displaying output from a terminal. However, the Outputs
folder is to accept any arbitrary stream of text, and any arbitrary parser.
